# Composition experiment log (per PROTOCOL.md)

## Dev phase (BEAM, both embedders) — complete

Full tables in `compose_minilm.log` / `compose_qwen3.log`; per-question rows
in `results-compose/`.

Feasibility (cost vs sim on overlap=False ≤ 0.010, CI midpoint, per embedder):

| candidate | MiniLM cost | Qwen3 cost | feasible | mean adaptivity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| beta0.1 | −0.0000 | +0.0031 | yes | +0.0079 |
| beta0.2 | +0.0003 | +0.0042 | yes | +0.0091 |
| **beta0.3** | +0.0028 | +0.0081 | **yes** | **+0.0120** |
| beta0.5 | +0.0038 | +0.0172 | no (Qwen3) | — |
| rrf | +0.3826 | +0.4759 | no | — |
| shortlist | +0.3658 | +0.4488 | no | — |

rrf and shortlist fail feasibility by an order of magnitude: any composition
that gives the raw rfm ordering equal or unchecked authority is destroyed by
the prior's dynamic range. Only bounded multiplicative influence survives.

**Protocol-gap note (disclosed):** the rule-3 tie-break was written to prefer
across families; the three feasible candidates are one family within 0.005
adaptivity of each other, so rule 3 does not discriminate. Resolved by strict
rule-2 argmax. Sensitivity of conclusions to β ∈ {0.1, 0.2} is visible in the
committed curves.

## FROZEN CONFIGURATION (committed before any test-set run)

**beta-blend, β = 0.3**: `score = max(sim, 0) × (0.7 + 0.3 · rfm_score(id))`

Test plan (one shot, per PROTOCOL.md): LoCoMo (MiniLM, Qwen3) — primary;
knowledge-update (MiniLM), SWE-Bench-CL (MiniLM, Qwen3), and unseen-embedder
BAAI/bge-m3 (LoCoMo, SWE) — secondary. Results appended below after the runs;
no re-tuning regardless of outcome.

## Test phase — PENDING
